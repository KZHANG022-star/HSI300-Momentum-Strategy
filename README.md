# HSI300-Momentum-Strategy
Inspired by the strong performance of SPMO, this strategy is designed to test the effectiveness of the momentum factor within the China large-cap index, namely the HSI300. The Invesco S&amp;P 500 Momentum ETF tracks the S&amp;P 500 Momentum Index, which selects S&amp;P 500 stocks with high momentum scores and weights them by market cap and momentum.
